                <h2>Matt Ryan</h2>
                <p>
                    After the heartbreaking loss in Super Bowl LI, Matt Ryan continued to play for the Falcons until 2021. In 2022, he was traded to the Indianapolis Colts, where he currently plays as their starting quarterback. Ryan has had a solid career with the Colts, but he has yet to reach the same heights he achieved with the Falcons. The trade marked a new chapter in his career, but it didn't last long and only played for that one season, before ultimatley retiring. Ryan's legacy with the Falcons remains intact, as he is remembered for his leadership and performance during their Super Bowl run.

        <h2>Current Season Outlook</h2>
        <p>
            As I talk about the disappointment the Falcons have been for the last 16 years, they are currently fighting for a playoff spot in this 2025 season. They have won 8 of their last 10 games and are in a crucial stretch of the season. Their next 4 games are against the Buccaneers, Panthers, Saints, and 49ers, all playoff teams, and two of them being division rivals. If they can get through this stretch with a good record, they will be in a great position to make the playoffs. But if they struggle, it could be another disappointing season in Atlanta. Hopefully they can pull off what the 2024 Falcons came so close to achieving. The reigning MVP Kyle Pitts is having another MVP caliber season, and if he can continue to play at this level, the Falcons have a great chance to make a deep playoff run with their new quarterback Michael Penix Jr, RB Bijan Robinson, and WR Drake London. One of the best young cores in the NFL.
