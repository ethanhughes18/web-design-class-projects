            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This page provides an overview of Giancarlo Stanton's Hall of Fame case. I've seen a lot of talk recently asking if Stanton deserves to be in the Hall of Fame, and I'm here to clear the air. Giancarlo Stanton 100% deserves to be considered a HoFer because of his postseason performances and his overall ability to hit a baseball. He has 444 career home runs and has an MVP that he earned in 2017 when he hit 59 home runs, so it's absurd that people believe he shouldn't be in the Hall of Fame. And the reason some believe he's not a hall of famer is because of his injury history. But I think that speaks more into why he should make it, because he has done so much while being injured for a big amount of his career. Lets get more into it...</p>
